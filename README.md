# Should we have business logic in the UI?

How many times did you say or hear “this is business logic, it should not be here”?

In this workshop, we will create a modern frontend application using old patterns and you will learn how to build apps that have decoupled UI and services.

We will start with a React application that has its whole logic in the UI. Then step by step we will extract the rules and operations to hit that sweet spot of independence.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
